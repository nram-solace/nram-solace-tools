# Apply VPN Config

This script takes VPN config captured by [get-vpn-config](../docs/get-vpn-config.md) and clones them on a dMyerent Solace PubSub+ broker or on the same broker with dMyerent name. During clone, some objects can be optionally skipped. For e.g. while cloning UAT message-vpn to Production, all queues starting "test" can be configured to skipped.

## Running
